Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ahmad Asili, a 23-year-old web developer who's passionate about developing web applications. I dedicate a significant portion of my time to developing projects driven by both my curiosity and the goal of aiding small businesses in scaling and fostering growth.

Presently, I'm in my last year studying web development at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, continuously honing my skills in this dynamic field. My aim is to keep growing, learning, and honing my craft while exploring new possibilities.

Learning quickly is something I thrive on, and every project becomes a chance to soak up more knowledge. It's this continuous growth that drives me forward.
